# Gitub
Set-up ssh connection for gitlab and gitub

This page is for first time user of git. 

## What's git and ssh?

```git``` is the software that manages the versioning of files, it forces users to version their files systematically. 
Therefore git is different than gitlab, github, or bitbucket, which are forges. 
A forge is a web-based collaborative software platform for both developing and sharing computer applications. 
Gitub and GitLab uses the SSH protocol to securely communicate with Git. 
SSH stands for Secure Shell and is a cryptographic protocol based on the concept of public-private keys.
```git``` is a distributed version control system, which means you can work locally, then share or push your changes to a server. In this case, the server you push to is GitLab
When you use SSH keys to authenticate to the GitLab remote server, you donâ€™t need to supply your username and password each time.

## What I need to do ?

1. First get a [github account](https://github.com).
2. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - note that it is already available in datarmor
3. Set up ```git``` with your user name and email.
4. Generate a SSH key
5. Generate a token to use as password for ```git``` 

### How to check if ```git``` is installed?

Open any terminal and check if you already have Git installed by typing:

```bash 
git --version
```
If you are getting back an error message, you need to install Git.

### How to configure ```git```?

Open a terminal/shell and type:
``` bash 
git config --global user.name "Your name here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```
This command allows git to make the link with your email address.
To enable colored output in the terminal, you can (optionnally) type:
``` bash 
git config --global color.ui true
``` 

### How to generate ssh on your computer or on datarmor?

SSH uses two keys, a public key and a private key:
- The public key can be distributed
- The private key should be protected

To communicate with Gitub and GitLab, you can use the several SSH key types (see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html).
Here, we will generate a ed25519 keytype:
``` bash 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
``` 
A message will appear below 
``` bash 
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
``` 
Accept the suggested filename and directory by pressing ``Enter`` and specify a passphrase
``` bash 
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
``` 

Then, copy the SSH key generated to include it into your github/Gitlab account
``` bash 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
``` 

Go to you github account, in the Settings (access from the top-right corner on your image profile).
Then, in the SSH

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
